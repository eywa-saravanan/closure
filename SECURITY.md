Hi,

we face security issue.. need for solution..

issue detail given below

package name : opis/closure

Package link : https://github.com/opis/closure.git

issue description : 

line numbers :
a) vendor/opis/closure/src/ReflectionClosure.php:750

1) An attacker can exploit CRC32â€™s weaknesses to manipulate data, leading to potential security breaches and loss of data integrity.

solution need like this : It is recommended to avoid using CRC32 for hashing when security is a concern. Instead, opt for stronger hashing algorithms like SHA-256 to ensure data integrity and security.


thanks
